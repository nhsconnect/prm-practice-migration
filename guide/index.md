This guide aims to help Practices, GP IT delivery partners (such as Commissioning Support Units) and Commissioning Clinical Groups (CCGs) plan and implement migrations from one clinical solution to another. 
<!-- [UPLIFT] removed the word 'migration' -->
<!-- [UPLIFT] replaced 'system' with 'solution' -->
Approaches to migration can differ by region. This guide contains a collection of common phases and strategies aimed at reducing the impact to Practice staff and minimising the amount of manual data re-entry which is a common problem when migrating solutions.

The guide does not cover everything that may need to happen in your migration but it will cover the key activities and make suggestions on how to act on them. It will continue to be updated, as the GP IT Futures framework develops and matures.
<!-- [UPLIFT] Added disclaimer to mention that the guide is not exhaustive in terms of reflecting all changes in the GP IT F framework -->

Two key documents are referenced throughout this guide:
<!-- [UPLIFT] Added explanation that these two documents have content that appears throughout the guide -->
>* GP IT Futures Catalogue Solution Migration Process
<!-- [GAP] Ancillary document is not yet publicly available although it is available to all supplier onboarded to the Catalogue. We will need to find a place where this document is stored online (e.g. GitHub?) -->
>* GP IT Futures Data Migration Standard
<!-- [GAP] Data Migration is not yet publicly available to those without Confluence access. We will need to find a place where this document is stored online. -->

When you see reference to an 'SLA', this is a Service Level Agreement that appears in the Catalogue Solution Migration Process. When you see reference to a 'DMI' code, this item is a requirement that forms part of the Data Migration Standard. The Data Migration Standard applies only to those Solutions, which are registered on the GP IT Futures Catalogue or Framework.
<!-- [UPLIFT] Added explanation regarding how that additional content appears when lifted from those documents. Also added qualifier to explain that DMI requirements only apply to registered solutions, as per the Data Migration Standard -->

<br>Performing a migration inevitably involves access to - and processing of - significant amounts of sensitive personal information. It's crucial, therefore, that all parties involved are compliant with the following laws, policies, standards and guidelines in respect to Information Governance:

## How long does a migration take?

Migrations on average take between 12-16 weeks. This is from the point of registering the intent to migrate on the Catalogue to the end of the [Post Go Live](/prm-practice-migration/guide/post-go-live) activities.

<!-- [UPLIFT] Replaced 'activity is complete' with 'activities'-->

<!-- [GAP] Need to add details that explain how to register intent to migrate via the Catalogue -->
<!-- [GAP] Do we need to retain reference to the Tracking Database here? -->
<!-- [GAP] Should we add something like 'process to be confirmed' within the actual guide? -->


## Overview of key phases

Migrations require a lot of planning and effort from practice staff, breaking this activity into smaller incremental steps will help ease the pressure and make the migration effort more sustainable. 
Here is an overview of the key phases...
