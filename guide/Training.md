## Who provides training?

The approach, amount and timing of training widely differs from region to region and can happen throughout the end to end migration process. 

* Some Practices receive training from the GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit) where they have dedicated trainers

* Some Practices receive training from the new supplier (The new supplier of the GP Core System)


## General recommendations for training

* Book rooms for training early

* Arrange for external monitors to be used, if available
<!-- [UPLIFT] added reference to device setup -->
* After kick-off and before cut-over meeting, hold a training meeting to look at the training needs at an individual basis, create a training schedule and slot staff in

* If possible, draft in additional support/cover so that there is dedicated people/time for training on the new solution

* Remember to include staff who may work remotely / away from the Practice building on training

* Supplier trainers tend to follow fixed training plans so make sure to agree upfront what the Practice needs are and whether you want to deviate from the planned agenda.

* Arrange pre-cutover training as close to the cutover date as you can for training information retention

* If possible, try to hold onto some training days to use after the migration and use for times where staff will be using a different part of the solution or module. For example, you may want to reserve time for Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) module training when QOF is due. If the practice covered this module during the migration in September, but do not use this part of the solution until February/March they may not retain all the information
