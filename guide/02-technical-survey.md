Following your Kick-off meeting, an engineer will need to complete a Technical Survey on site at the practice. 



## What is the Technical Survey?

The survey is to check the existing practice setup, focused mainly on the following three areas...

* __Hardware__ – All Hardware, such as client PCs, servers, arrivals kiosk, call display etc should be checked to ensure that they meet the required minimum specification for running the Target System. For dispensing practices, barcode scanner and label printer compatibility also need to be checked.
* __Network__ – Any existing network issues that may require addressing and may require extra chargeable engineering services, post go live, 
* __3rd party application/software compatibility__ - Applications that the Practice may use that are not part of the existing/old principal clinical solution but may be connecting to it. For example, DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management



Some GP IT delivery partners (such as Commissioning Support Units) will download and install the Target System icons, to all the compatible devices following the survey, but this may only be installed on a small number of devices by suppliers.

## Who completes this activity?

The Technical Survey can be completed by the new supplier (target), or in some cases by an engineer from the GP IT delivery partner (For example, a Commissioning Support Unit). It may be carried out onsite or remotely.
<!-- [UPLIFT] based on user feedback, added sentence that this may be carried out remotely -->

Make sure to check to see who will complete this activity.

[As previously noted](/prm-practice-migration/guide/kick-off#technical-survey), it is the responsibility of the practice to ensure that thay have contacted their third party software suppliers to check if the software is compatible with the new GP clinical solution and agree any actions required for implementation. The new supplier (target) may be aware of the compatability/incompatability of common 3rd party applications but is not accountable for confirming.



## The outcome of the Technical Survey {#outcome-of-the-technical-survey}

The Technical survey may result in the identification of new or additional hardware being required for purchase and unexpected costs. This may not apply in all cases. Any additional costs should be discussed with the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).

The Practice will be asked to sign off a form for Technical requirements.

Any incompatible equipment should be replaced prior to Go Live.
