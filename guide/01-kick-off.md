## Purpose of Kick-off Meeting
<!-- [UPLIFT] changed sub-heading from 'What is a Kick-off?' -->
A ‘Kick-off’ is where you gather all the key people who will be involved in your migration to discuss the end to end process of migrating your solution. The objective is to assign roles and get everyone on the same page about what needs to happen and when.


### As a priority, you should discuss...

* The key milestones and week by week activities


* Agree on dates and targets for the above milestones and activities


* Who will be involved in the migration and what are their roles and responsibilities?


* How you will communicate and share information?

  -- Between yourselves

  -- With third parties

  -- [With practice staff](#make-staff-aware)

  -- [With patients](#notification-of-patients)
  
* Scope of the data migration

* Risks ownership and mitigations

* Hazard Log

* Rollback scenarios and approach

* Any solution downtime and impact on core hours


### For the Kick-off meeting, you should involve at a minimum...

* The migration Project manager - This may be a representative from your GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit), the Clinical Commissioning Group or in some cases the Practice manager or lead GP


* Practice managers - Including any staff that will play a role in managing/supporting the migration


* Target solution supplier - The supplier of the clinical solution you are moving to

Note: When the GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit) is leading the migration, they may invite other personnel to the Kick-off such as Business change, Training leads, Data quality etc.

## Key milestones, activities, dates and targets

By now you should have agreed on your Go Live date. Take a look at the [surrounding phases](/prm-practice-migration/guide#overview-of-key-phases) and put dates in your plan of when any activities need to be completed (Use the content on this site to guide you). It is worthwhile stepping through each of the phases and making sure that everyone is aligned on what the phase objective is and what the key activities are within them. For example, you should have a plan for the following dates:

* Clinical Risk Assessments <!-- [UPLIFT] added reference to Clinical Risk Assessment -->
<!-- [GAP] need to check whether this assessment is the same as the supplier submitting a 'Clinical Safety Health Report and Hazard Log'; see Step 2 of the Ancillary Document -->
* Technical Survey (if not already arranged)
* Initial data production and testing days
* Final data production and cutover
* Go Live
* Training days

As you go, you may want to create a shared list of actions for each phase, with a column for a target date,  who will complete the action and a status/update column. Use this list to track progress throughout the migration.

## Clinical Risk Assessments

Once the data migration approach and plans have been agreed by all parties, there is a need to complete a Clinical Risk Assessment to consider any risks to clinical and patient safety. If you consider there to be a material risk associated with the migration, you will need to escalate this through Service Management.
<!-- [UPLIFT] added new paragraph on Clinical Risk Assessments -->
<!-- [GAP] need to make escalation note more specific. I.e change from 'Service Management' to 'Migration Management Agent' or similar -->

## Who, roles and responsibilities

As part of the Kick-off, you should discuss who should be involved in the migration and what their roles and responsibilities will be. If people are not present in the Kick-off, think about how you will onboard them and understand their role. As you work through your list of roles, capture and consolidate any contact information for individuals, including out-of-hours contact details for one or two key members of the practice (in case there is a requirement to make contact due to issues arising outside of normal working hours). 

Here is a list of common organisations and functions you may wish to engage with and involve in your migration.

* Project manager
* Practice manager
* Practice staff
* A General Practitioner to act as a lead 
* Clinical staff (including people who may work remotely)
* GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit)
* Explore with your GP IT delivery partner the availability of any supporting roles such as Business change, Training leads, Data quality teams etc
* Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG)
* New supplier (target) - The new supplier of the GP clinical solution
* Existing supplier (Source) - Existing supplier of the GP clinical solution
* Surrounding and community services - Pharmacies, Pathology labs, [Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service), [GP2GP](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp2gp), [Summary Care Records (SCR)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-records-scr), Out of hours, 111 and any screening services etc 
* Any third party solution supplier that integrates with your principal clinical solution, for example, DocMan or Apollo Scan, DispensIT



## Schedule regular migration meetings

Now is a good time to schedule regular migration meetings.

* We suggest holding them on a weekly basis at the same time


* Book rooms and make sure everyone who needs to can attend


* Keep call conference IDs tools consistent i.e. try to reuse the same conference call setup so that all participants can access it easily and repeatedly


* Agree how you’ll all communicate and share information between meetings



## Check dates against availability

Look at your key dates and the people you need

* Plan for critical days - identify and make sure that people are made aware and will be available


* Do staff have pre-booked holidays or training planned?


* Are there any planned events or surgeries during this time that suggest the practice may be busier than usual?

The aim is to ensure a successful migration and limit the impact on the practice by reducing the amount of practice activity happening during the [cut-over period](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over#what-is-the-cut-over) (and 2 days after Go Live) and increase the availability of people to support the migration.

###  Secure your dates and people’s time 

* Block time for your key dates

* Encourage staff to keep these dates free and if possible avoid booking holidays on these dates

* If possible, and alternative dates are available, avoid planning any events or data rich chronic disease clinics during the [cut-over period](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over#what-is-the-cut-over) that may increase the workload of the practice e.g. Asthma reviews

* Pre-book rooms for training, testing and any other migration activity

* Put breather slots in the rotas for the first couple of days post go-live if your clinicians are not familiar with the new supplier solution (target).



## Additional topics for your Kick-off

The Kick-off is a good opportunity to also run through the following...


### Common data issues, housekeeping and clean-up tasks

Ask the new supplier (target) or GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit) to walk through any common/known data issues when migrating to the new solution - these may vary from solution to solution. 

The objective is to identify any tasks that the Practice can start rectifying early and before the [Initial data production phase](initial-data-production). As time goes on, the amount of work the Practice needs to complete will grow, so getting ahead can ease the pressure.

If you have access to a Data Quality team (possibly part of your Commissioning Support Unit), involve them now.

Discuss and plan any housekeeping tasks such as…

* The appropriate management of duplicate and orphaned records which will not migrate to the new solution
<!-- [GAP] need to clarify whether the work of the 'Orphaned Records' team has reached a stage where this bullet point can be updated -->
* Complete a review of letter and data entry templates to identifty those that will need to be re-entered into the new solution. Note; letter and data entry templates will need to be manually copied over. Completing this review will make it easier to identify which templates you need in the new solution

* Clearing down the practice inboxes, outstanding workflows and all open communication tasks, for example, pathology and registration;  as you approach the [Final data production day](/prm-practice-migration/guide/cutover-and-go-live#final-data-production), you will want to have zero tasks outstanding 

Now is also a good time to introduce the [Data checking tasks](/prm-practice-migration/guide/pre-migration-tasks#data-checking-preparation) and what the practice will need to do during the [Planning and preparation](early-prep-and-planning) phase, such as finding patients that match the test criteria supplied by the new supplier (target).


### Technical survey and hardware {#technical-survey}

If the Practice is not already aware, the [Technical survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) (try to schedule this shortly after the Kick-off) may result in the identification of new or additional hardware being required for purchase and unexpected costs. This may not apply in all cases. You may want to highlight this early so that the Practice and Clinical Commissioning Group are aware of this possibility before the Technical survey is completed.

Compile a list of third party software that integrate with the current GP clinical solution.

Please note that it is the responsibility of the practice to ensure that thay have contacted their third party software suppliers to check if the software is compatible with the new GP clinical solution and agree any actions required for implementation. The new supplier (target) will not complete this activity.


### Notification of 3rd parties and links

Make a list of all the supporting/connecting solutions and community services that the Clinical solution or the Practice works with, for example...

<!-- removed based on user feedback
* [Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service)
* [GP2GP](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp2gp)
* [Summary Care Records (SCR)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/summary-care-records-scr) -->


* Pathology labs and any other services or providers that send information and results automatically to the existing solution. For example, Bowel screening, Hospital letters, 111, Out of hours


* Pharmacies



* [Primary Care Support England](https://pcse.england.nhs.uk/)


* [Subsidiary and Third party solution suppliers](/prm-practice-migration/guide/pre-migration-tasks#subsidiary-suppliers), for example, DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management

Next, plan and schedule how you will give notice to them of your solution change. The earlier you give notice of your Cut-over and Go Live dates the better. The notice period required will vary, for example, the Electronic Prescription Service may require 5 weeks, whereas another service may require 5 days. 

If you use any third party software as part of your clinical solution, please be aware that reconfiguration work may be required by them after you have migrated to the new clinical solution [Post Go Live](post-go-live).

Add a task to your plan to contact and remind each party the week before and on the day when you require changes to be made.

### Notification of Patients {#notification-of-patients}

During the migration, you may need to remove access to online services such as the ability to book appointments online and you may also require patients to re-register on your new online service solution (if applicable). Therefore, discuss how you will notify patients in advance. Most practices display posters for many weeks in advance to create awareness. 

You may also want to discuss what online messaging is put in place when the service is removed e.g. what happens if a patient tries to access the online service when it ceases to be available. You may want to add this as a topic on the practice patient forum.

Remember to make any necessary changes to your Practice website. For example, Online Access Links.

### Make staff aware of the coming changes {#make-staff-aware}

Are the practice staff (and anyone who works remotely) aware of the change? Think about what questions they may have and how you plan to answer them.

### Training

We recommend you find out who will deliver training and make contact with the relevant team to discuss delivery. [Read more about training](training).
