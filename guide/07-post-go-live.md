By now you will have completed the Go-Live steps and the practice staff are now using the new clinical solution and all data entered from now on will be maintained.


## Switch links back on and notify 3rd parties {#switch-on-links}

Now your new solution is up and running you can contact all the connecting solutions and community services that the Clinical solution or the Practice works with, to switch services back on, for example:

* Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)


* Pathology and test labs


* Pharmacies


* Third party software/solution suppliers, for example DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management

If you use any third party software as part of your clinical solution, please be aware that reconfiguration work may be required by them now that the practice has migrated to the new clinical solution. 


## Data re-entry

If you have followed any manual processes during cutover that you established during the [Cutover planning phase](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over#appointments), you can now start the task of re-entering the data captured.

The approach to this can differ depending on preferences. 

* Some practices choose to copy and paste data from the old solution to the new
* Some practices choose to retype the notes from printouts they have created during the cutover


{%- capture lesson_learnt_1 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - You may wish to draft in additional cover so that there are people and time dedicated to doing data re-entry. Practices that do not have dedicated time and people for data re-entry can struggle to complete the activity and causes additional strain on staff
{%- endcapture -%}

{%- include inset.html content=lesson_learnt_1 accessibility_text="Lesson learnt" markdown=true -%}

The average time to complete data re-entry can vary largely due to practice size and whether the practice has arranged dedicated people to do the required data re-entry.

Practices who allocate staff to do data re-entry need a week to do this.
### Tasks include
<!-- [GAP] once we reach maturity with any of the GP2GP solutions, these can be added here -->
* Printed appointments (or screenshots) are manually re-entered 

* Printed Prescriptions are manually re-entered 

* Practice re-does any outstanding scripts on the spine for Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) repeat dispensing patients that were cancelled in the pre-migration preparation work

* Pathology results will be sent electronically to the new solution. These will need to be filed/actioned as appropriate.
<!-- [UPLIFT] updated description of pathology results according to user feedback -->
* Any results that are not normally sent electronically will need to be manually re-entered 

* Patient consultations are manually re-entered

* Printed Referrals (urgent referrals) are manually re-entered 



## Registration

Patient registration capability should now be available.


## Online services

Online patient services such as the ability to book appointments online are made available, however, it's likely that patients will need to be re-registered individually by practice staff as the Online services patient data is not migrated by the supplier. You may want to find out which patients frequently used the Online services provided by the previous supplier and prioritise these for re-registration.


## Access to the old solution

The old solution is now read-only. Practices will require access to this, however, for cross referencing data, validation and mapping. If you require an extended access period, this should be agreed with the Clinical Commissioning Group and the new Supplier as this may incur additional costs (and is explained further in the next section of this guide).
