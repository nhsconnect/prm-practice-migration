## The decision to migrate and funding {#decision-to-migrate-and-funding}

When ordering a new solution, <em>it is the responsibility of the buyer to check that all of the interoperability functionality meets your requirements</em>. In other words, if you order a solution that does not fully meet your needs, as the buyer you may need to default on your contract and pay penalties.
<!-- [UPLIFT] added 'buyer beware' disclaimer to prompt practices that it's their responsibility to check interoperability -->

This guide begins from the point at which the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) has approved the practice’s request to change their foundation solution and is ready to start the migration process.
<!-- [UPLIFT] replaced 'system' with 'solution' -->

Note: This is subject to the conditions described in the [CCG-Practice Agreement](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/terms-governing-the-provision-and-receipt-of-gpsoc-services-and-gp-it-services/)) 

Prior to this, there are a number of steps that will have been completed such as:

* Practice completes a selection process under the GP IT Futures framework
<!-- [UPLIFT] Added reference to the need for the selection process -->
* Practice completes a [business justification template](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/business-justification-guidance-for-change-of-gp-it-futures-foundation-solution-template/) for a change of GP IT Future foundation solution.
<!-- [UPLIFT] New process for completing business case template -->

* Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and any local boards approve the business case and secure funding. 

  -- _Note: there may be [further costs identified by the Technical Survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) for replacing hardware_


* Practice and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) engage with their GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit)


Once the decision to migrate has been confirmed, the next steps are to:


### Agree a provisional Go Live date

A preferred Go Live date needs to be agreed between the Practice and the supporting functions  - usually the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and a GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit). 

A proposed go-live date should be agreed between the practice, Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and GP IT delivery partner. 

This proposed date should be agreed with the new clinical solution supplier.

__Recommendation__ - Avoid the busiest periods for your practice and surrounding area and watch out for any periods with a high volume of staff on training or annual leave.

### Register the migration on the Catalogue

The initial registration of the migration on the Catalogue is usually completed by the GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit) however this may differ by region.
<!-- [GAP] Need to add details that explain how to complete initial registration of the migration on the Catalogue -->

#### Order the new solution
<!-- [UPLIFT] This needs to say 'order' not procure-->
<!-- [UPLIFT] replaced 'system' with 'solution' -->
Place the order using the agreed Catalogue processes (to be confirmed).

* CCG approves the order
* The new supplier receives and accepts the order

<!--
<!-- [GAP] Not sure if supplier is allowed to constrain preferred Go Live dates as indicated by practice i.e.
* The new supplier confirms the availability of the preferred Go Live dates -->

<!-- [GAP] this section is commented out because it's too generic
* Procurement documents are completed for the new supplier (target) and are “called off”/logged in the Catalogue
* The Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) validates these procurement documents in the Catalogue
* The new supplier (target) is notified that the procurement documents have been submitted and validates them
* The new supplier (target) will confirm the availability of the preferred Go Live dates

<!--{%- capture lesson_learnt_2 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - Submodules of the new clinical solution may need to be raised within the procurement documents and this activity can be missed. For example, appointments modules, document management, data entry forms.

### Request a data extract from your existing supplier (source) {#request-data-extract}
A formal data extract request needs to be sent to the existing supplier (source) using the [steps detailed below](#steps-to-request-data-extract). This is a formal notification from the practice to the supplier for them to provide the data stored in the current clinical solution. The extract will be used in the [Initial data production phase](initial-data-production).
__The request needs to be completed as early as possible__. 
**_SLA:_**  The Source Solution Supplier has no more than 5 working days to provide all the data extract(s) you request in an agreed, encrypted, electronic format.
<br><em>(GP IT Futures Catalogue Solution Migration Process, p. 13)</em>
Data extract requests will also need to be submitted to any other suppliers who will need to migrate data. For example, any document management and scanning solutions such as DocMan or anticoagulation management software such as INR Star.
#### Steps to requesting the data extract {#steps-to-request-data-extract}
1. A request is made to the existing supplier (source) to provide a ‘Data extract request form’ or similar. This is usually sent by the GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit) but this may differ by region. 
2. The existing supplier will send a ‘Data extract request form’ (or similar) directly to the practice 
3. The practice completes and returns the form to the existing supplier (source) along with the dates of when the extract is to be delivered as advised by the new supplier (Dates for the [Initial data production phase](initial-data-production)
4. The Source Supplier will ensure that the data is transferred to the new supplier (target) safely and securely.

### Arrange your Kick-off and Technical Survey
Plan and book your [Kick-off meeting](/prm-practice-migration/guide/kick-off) and [Technical Survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) to happen within a few days of each other.
